This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript's error handling related to the `IsEmpty` function. The `bug.vbs` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version.  The issue stems from the way VBScript handles errors when `IsEmpty` is used with unexpected input.  The solution improves error handling for better robustness.
